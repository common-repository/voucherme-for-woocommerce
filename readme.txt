Allow your customers to purchase eVouchers & Hard Copy Vouchers on your website that can be redeemed both online and in-store.

== Description ==
Our Gift Voucher solution allows customers to purchase your gift vouchers 24/7 in a new and engaging way.  There are no set up costs, contracts or ongoing fees….EVER…..so we only make money when you do!

Your customers have the option to purchase both eVouchers & Hard Copy Vouchers.  eVouchers are sent to the recipient via text or email and delivered immediately, or any time the customer chooses in the future such as an anniversary, birthday, etc.   Hard Copy Vouchers are sent via ‘snail mail’ and you don’t have to worry about a thing as we take care of everything.

While we have created a complete Gift Voucher solution for you, we also created VoucherMe to give your customers a new experience in the purchasing and delivery of Gift Vouchers.  There are over 20 Occasions and 120 different card options to choose from and for the recipient, they don’t just get any old eVoucher….Oh No!  As an alternative to the standard email voucher our eVoucher is a <a href="https://www.voucherme.ie/card/8a8b2c40ad60ea754d0616fb6580478c" target="_blank">dynamic gift card</a> that pops out of an envelope, and depending on the occasion chosen, is accompanied by love hearts, balloons or fireworks.  

From your VoucherMe dashboard you have instant access to your gift voucher funds through your MangoPay eWallet.  Your funds are held securely in your eWallet and you have complete control of when and how much you want to draw down to your linked bank account.  You also have access to all your reporting needs, such as Voucher Sales, Voucher Redeem History & Vat Reports.
